# InugoCodeExample

This example project demonstrates a node.js back-end working with an Angular Front end.

Code for the node server is stored under the `/server` folder.
Code for the front-end is stored in the `/src` folder, and most of the components are in the `/src/app` folder.

## Build Everything

Run `npm build` to complie and run both the backend and frontend together. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will need to rebuild the app if you change any source files

## Complie Front-end

If you just want to build the font-end, run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
